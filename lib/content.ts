 * because each item dilutes the one before it and the reader stops absorbing
 * around the fourth. So each card now makes ONE claim, the AI work, and the
 * employers sit underneath it as ballast rather than as the pitch.
 *
 * Deliberately dropped, and not to be quietly reinstated: the hackathon win,
 * the Megaw Lecture placing, the MISO research listing and the degree classes.
 * Competition placings do not sell to the person doing the hiring, and the
 * cards are stronger for making one point clearly. Everything cut is still on
 * their LinkedIn, which each card links to.
 *
 * `bio` and `background` are one paragraph each. Keep them to that: the whole
